# Automated Tweet Response System  

This project delivers an innovative solution for Twitter-based customer support, seamlessly integrating real-time data processing, machine learning, and automated ticket generation to enhance customer service efficiency.  

## Key Features  

- **Real-Time Tweet Processing**: Leverages Spark Streaming for instant tweet analysis, ensuring faster response times.  
- **Advanced Complaint Analysis**: Implements a two-stage machine learning process:  
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluates user emotions from tweets.  
  - **Complaint Classification**: Categorizes issues into types such as billing or technical problems.  
  - **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extracts specific details like locations from tweets.  
- **Automated Ticketing System**: Automatically generates and routes support tickets based on analysis outcomes.  
- **Data Storage for Insights**: Archives processed data in a data lake, enabling detailed analysis and proactive issue resolution.  

## Project Structure  

- **Engines**: Contains core ML models and processing logic.  
- **Helpers**: Includes utilities for text preprocessing, model evaluation, API integration, and Twitter communication.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Spark Streaming**: Facilitates real-time data ingestion.  
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: Utilizes Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow for model development.  
- **Kafka**: Manages message queueing and streaming.  
- **Twitter API**: Integrates real-time tweet streams.  
- **Data Lake Solutions**: Provides scalable and efficient data storage.  

## How It Works  

1. Real-time tweets are captured using streaming tools.  
2. Sentiment analysis determines user emotions in the tweets.  
3. Complaint classification identifies the issue type.  
4. The NER model extracts key details, such as locations or names.  
5. Tickets are generated and routed to the appropriate teams.  
6. All processed data is archived for strategic insights and improved issue resolution.
